# Excel-Peppi Integration

This project is an UiPath integration for copying grades from Excel to Peppi with supervised automation. Peppi is a study record system, where teachers often copy grades manually from Excel sheets. This automation streamlines the copying process while making it less prone to errors in manual entry.

The subfolder [test_data](test_data/) contains [a mock implementation of the course grading interface in Peppi system](./test_data/index.html), which can be used while testing and developing.
