# Excel-Peppi Integration

This project is an UiPath integration for copying grades from Excel to Peppi with supervised automation. Peppi is a study record system, where teachers often copy grades manually from Excel sheets. This automation streamlines the copying process while making it less prone to errors in manual entry.

The subfolder [test_data](test_data/) contains a mock implementation of the course grading interface in Peppi system, which can be used while testing and developing. You can see it live [here](https://raw.githack.com/swd1tn002/ExcelPeppiIntegration/master/test_data/index.html).
